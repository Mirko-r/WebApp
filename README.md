## Description

This repository houses a web application built with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture using C# and Asp.Net, and incorporates SQL Server along with Entity Framework. In this context, the term "models" refers to the components responsible for representing and managing the data logic of the application. They encapsulate the business rules and database interactions, serving as a bridge between the database and the application's logic.

## MVC Architecure

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture is a design pattern commonly used in software development to organize code and separate concerns within an application. It divides the application into three interconnected components, each with a specific responsibility:

- ### Models
  - The Model represents the application's data and business logic. It encapsulates the data structure, rules, and behavior of the application. In the context of a web application, the model interacts with the database to retrieve and store data.
  - The Model is responsible for managing the state of the application and ensuring data integrity. It responds to requests from the Controller, updates its state, and notifies the View of any changes.

- ### Views
  - The View is responsible for presenting the application's data to the user. It displays the information retrieved from the Model and provides the user interface for interacting with the application.
  - In a web application, the View typically consists of HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript. It is concerned with the visual representation of the data and user interactions but does not handle data manipulation or business logic.

- ### Controllers
  - The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user inputs from the View, processes them, and invokes the appropriate methods on the Model to update the data or retrieve information.
  - In a web application, the Controller is often responsible for handling HTTP requests, interpreting user actions, and determining the appropriate response. It coordinates the flow of data between the Model and the View.

## Used Techonlogies
- ### C#
  - #### Role:
    C# (pronounced C-sharp) is a versatile, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. In the MVC architecture, C# is primarily used for implementing the backend logic of the application.
  - #### Responsibilities:
    Implements business logic and application rules within the Model component.
    Processes user inputs and manages the flow of data between the Controller and the Model.
    Executes operations such as data validation, computation, and other application-specific tasks.
- ### ASP.NET
   - #### Role:
     ASP.NET is a web development framework developed by Microsoft, and within MVC, it serves as the foundation for building the web application.
   - #### Responsibilities:
      Manages the routing of incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate Controller.
      Facilitates the generation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript content for the View.
      Provides a set of tools and libraries for building web applications, offering features like session management, authentication, and more.
- ### Entity Framework
    - #### Role:
      Entity Framework is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool provided by Microsoft. It acts as a bridge between the application's logic and the database, simplifying database interactions.
    - #### Responsibilities:
      Maps C# objects in the Model to database entities, easing the translation between the application's object-oriented model and the relational database model.
      Simplifies database operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records by providing a higher-level, object-oriented interface.
      Manages the communication and synchronization between the application and the underlying database.
- ### SQL Server
  - #### Role:
    SQL Server is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft. It is utilized within the MVC architecture for storing and managing the application's data.
  - #### Responsibilities:
    Persists and retrieves data used by the application's Model component.
        Ensures data integrity and provides mechanisms for transactions and relational data management.
        Allows for the definition and manipulation of database schemas, tables, and relationships.
